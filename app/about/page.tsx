      <p className="mb-6">
        ABU-KU Agro Farms is a 6-acre cardamom farm focused on supporting small farmers and improving the supply chain for high-quality produce. We collect cardamom from surrounding small farms, store it in our warehouse, and handle processing, cleaning, and packaging. By centralizing these activities, we ensure better quality, fair pricing, and timely delivery to markets.
